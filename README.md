# Edge-Detecting Robot

## Overview

The Edge-Detecting Robot is an IoT project designed to autonomously navigate and detect edges on its path, avoiding potential falls. The robot is built using an Arduino UNO board, an L298 motor driver module, two HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors, and two wheels powered by motors.

## Components

- **Arduino UNO Board**
- **L298 Motor Driver Module**
- **2 x HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors**
- **2 Wheels with Motors**

## Functionality

- The robot utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect edges and obstacles in its path.
- It autonomously adjusts its movement to avoid falling off edges.
- Simple and effective design suitable for educational purposes and robotics enthusiasts.
